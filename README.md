# Home Assistant UV Index Card

HAOS UV Index Card is a professional Lovelace UI card for Home Assistant that displays the real-time UV Index based on data from sensor.outdoor_uv_index. The card provides color-coded risk levels and protection recommendations according to WHO guidelines. It uses Mushroom Cards for a modern and clean design, making it easy to assess UV exposure at a glance.

This project is designed for Home Assistant OS (HAOS) and requires HACS for installation. The card is ideal for anyone who wants to monitor UV radiation and take appropriate sun protection measures directly from their Home Assistant dashboard.
